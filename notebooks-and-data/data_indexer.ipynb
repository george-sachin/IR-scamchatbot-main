Or counting our many blessings. First of all I am grateful for the nice weather that we had today I am grateful for the beautiful scenery that surround. There are lots of green trees green mountain and blue sky I am thankful for my family and everyone in it I am thankful for my health even though it's not perfect I am thankful to be raised in a family with the gospel I am thankful that our dog has lived as many years as she has I am thankful that the gospel is been restored to the earth with the priesthood and with the modern-day prophet I am thankful that young men and women have an opportunity to serve a mission I am thankful for each of our family members and for the personalities they have I am thankful for good neighbors who have always look out for us I am thankful for a veryGood board family Honestly I can't imagine what the other guy is talking about on his chats And I can't believe we still have four more days left of this competition Living gospel standards in the military service More than 20 years ago, I left for the military service. As I look back I am grateful for the influence this experience has had in my life You are now moving into a great and difficult adventure. It will challenge every fiber of your manhood, and what more could a young Ask them to have the opportunity of such a challenge Some of you have been in the mission field You have faced much of this kind of challenge That is the part that comes in being away from home. You have had the opportunity to face a task that was almost bigger than you You have weathered it. You knew what the homesickness is. You know what it is to get over homesickness and to face military With maybe a good deal more security than some of the rest of us There's one thing about homesickness, is it eventually disappears All at once. It doesn't just do it gradually fade out for some reason, just one day you're homesick and the next day you're not I suppose it's a growing up process I'd like to say to those of you who have not served a mission That I didn't have the privilege to serve a mission either. This is really hard to do without having someone regularly responding \"},\n",
